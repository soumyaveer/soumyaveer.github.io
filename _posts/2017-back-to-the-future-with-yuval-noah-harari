summary: It's very rare that an author takes you on a journey starting from the big bang to the current era and manages to hold your interest completely throughout the book. In Sapiens:A brief history of mankind, Yuval Noah Harari has successfully done this. It is one of the most interesting books I came across this year and so I decided to share it with you.

Since I was a child, I grew up learning “Man is a social Animal”. I still remember reading a chapter in my history book
about ‘Evolution of mankind’ with a diagram showing different stages of man evolving from ape on four legs to man on two.
It looked simple and gave the impression that our ancestors evolved peacefully. But, there is a lot of history behind
the transition from the stage of an ape to the final stage of a man, which _Yuval Noah Harari_ discusses in his
book - **Sapiens: A brief history of Humankind.**

Yuval Harari takes us back to 13.5 billion years ago, when “matter, energy, time and space came into being” ,
popularly known as “The Big Bang”. From here starts the tour of human species, the theories, history and beliefs behind
our evolution.

**Sapiens: A brief history of Humankind** is  divided into four parts: _Cognitive Revolution_, _Agricultural Revolution_,
_Unification of Humankind_ and _Scientific Revolution_.

The book begins with Yuval Harari discussing the fact that Homo Sapiens were not the only species among humans, we had other
cousins as well - _Homo Neanderthalensis_, _Homo Erectus_, _Homo Rudolfensis_, who were driven to extinction.The major reason
for the extinction was _Homo Sapiens_. And not only our cousins, Sapiens were responsible for the extinction of many other exotic
species all over the world.

Why did Sapiens became the reason for the demise of other species? The answer is _Cognitive Revolution_. The first signs
of evolution of brain was the discovery of fire, which changed the game for Sapiens. Earlier humans were somewhere in
the middle of the food chain, tigers and other predators being on top and plants at the bottom. With the discovery of
fire, the hunted became the hunter. Furthermore, due to genetic changes in Sapiens, they gained something that is very
rare among animals - _ability to gossip_. Yes! Gossip! With the ability to communicate and discovery of languages, now
Sapiens could share the knowledge with more and more people among their kinds and devise plans. With the power to gossip,
now they knew whom to trust and whom not to trust. Gradually, these hunter gatherers became larger groups and were
bonded by fiction, stories and spirits they believed in. Over a period of time, they started discovering new lands and
drove the natives of those lands to extinction, be it flora and fauna or the brethren Homo species .

The next stage of evolution was _Agricultural Revolution_. This was the transition of our ancestors from hunter-gatherers
 to farmers. Yuval Noah Harari mentions it as “History’s biggest fraud”, and here is the reason why. Our Hunter-gatherer
  ancestors decided to become farmers in pursuit of a stable and fulfilled life. They started the back-breaking
  work of farming from planting to caring of crops to carrying heavy buckets of water, saving them from the insects and
   weeding them, it was a hard labor work. Now, they could not move from place to place. They became dependent on the
   rain and the water sources nearby and they had to establish permanent settlements, which had to be saved from other
   hunter-gatherers, so, they had to fight for the land and their homes. Also, as hunter gatherers, they used to move
   from place to place. They ate food which had variety of nutrients. One day it was nuts, other day a feast of boar
   and next day, mushrooms. But with farming they were dependent on the crop that they were growing, so three times a
   day, day in day out, they ate the same meal, which resulted in malnutrition among people. Gradually with the creation
   of hierarchy, the dream of these farmers for a better future was lost. But now, after generations and generations
   of farming,  they could not turn back to being hunter-gatherers because the skills were lost and more than that the
   good old days were forgotten.

Next came the _Unification of Humankind_. The major discovery in this era was that of money. Earlier civilizations used barter system,
 but this was not a very convenient way of getting what you wanted. For example, say you have one bag of apples and you
  want clothes. But the tailor doesn't want apples, he needs shoes, so now, the only way barter would work is that
  hopefully the cobbler would want apples and in exchange of that he gives you shoes, so that you can barter them to
  get clothes. Phew! But what if cobbler doesn't want apples, he wants oranges. Oh god! Another problem with it was,
  how can the tailor be sure that the correct price of clothes is the sack of apples, last time he got two sacks, but
  they were of different quality. Again confusion! With the discovery of money, now everything became easy. You can buy
  clothes and pay in shells or stone coins or iron coins whatever works in your community. And from those coins a tailor
  can go and buy shoes and cobbler can buy oranges. Also, now the tailor knows that the price of one cloth is two shells.
   Life became a lot simpler!

The final stage according to the book is _Scientific Revolution_. This happened when Sapiens shed their believes of knowing everything under religions and started embracing their ignorance. Europe was the one holding important cards in this era. With the advancement of technology, Europeans started sailing to other parts of the world and discovering different cultures. With the increase in knowledge the European dominance was established over the world. The inventions of aeroplanes, telephones, radios and ultimately nuclear bombs gradually changed the face of the world.

In the current epoch, we are still inventing new technologies on daily basis. With the creation of genetically engineered animals and plants to cyborgs, we are on the path to technological progress, but the dream of hunter gatherers to achieve happiness is still not achieved. Yuval Noah Harari  concludes by saying that man came a long way from being an animal to playing a god with the power to create or destroy at its own will and yet have not found satisfaction. And leaves us with the question to ponder on “Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?”

This book gave a lot of answers to my questions like- How Sapiens evolved? What were the downsides of our evolution? Why did Sapiens become the reason for extinction of other species? and also gives some food for thought. For me _Sapiens : A brief history of Humankind_, was a book that proved to be intellectually simulating and an experience that I would like to go through again.
