This is exactly how I felt after I completed **The Tipping Point** by _Malcolm Gladwell_. It is one of
the few interesting reads that I came across last month. Full of information and case studies,
the book gives an insight on the fact that, “Ideas, products, messages and behaviors spread just
like wildfire.”

_Tipping point_ is that point in time when an idea gets viral and becomes huge. But this does not
happen on its own. Agents ,contents of the message and circumstances play an extremely vital role.

In this book, _Malcolm Gladwell_ discusses the three laws that cause this Tip.

First Law, is **The Law of Few** , which states “an idea or behavior spreads because of unusual quantities
 of few key groups of individuals”. This phenomenon is usually caused by agents which are
 called - _Connectors_, _Mavens_, and _Salesman_.

_Connectors_ are people who know almost everyone. When you look at a connector, you get astonished
 at the size of his social circle!
 _Mavens_ are people with specialized knowledge. If they give
 you an advice regarding a product, take it, because a Maven is always right. A maven makes it his/her
  job to know about all the products, prices and everything there is to know regarding a
  particular brand.
  Finally, _Salesman_. These are the people who have the capability of sending
  the sales of the product “spiraling upwards”, by there sheer enthusiasm and positivity.

Second Law, **The Stickiness Factor**. It states that the content of the message is as important
as the messenger bearing the message. For example _Seasame street_ a popular show was based on the
 fact that if they can hold the attention of children, they can educate them. Another popular series
  for children called _Blues Clues_ went a step further and repeated the same episode for five times
  in a row, which gave kids a chance to understand the clues properly. What better way to make a content
  stick to your mind than repeating it again and again?

And finally, **The Power of  Context**, states that human behavior can be easily influenced by its
 environment. For example, _The Broken Window_ concept, which states that a broken window in a
  building leads to increase in number of crimes in that community. Shocking! Right? But experiments
  have been conducted surrounding this concept. The explanation goes something like this, a
  broken window leads to the feeling of abandonment and discontent in society, which leads to
  people taking part in crimes and gradually the crime rate tips. Another example is the _Rule of 150_
  which states that a group larger than 150 is difficult to manage effectively.

_Tipping Point_ contains many interesting concepts like _Bystander problem_. When people are in a
 group, the responsibility diffuses. A person in need will get aid faster if he or she is surrounded
  by one person rather than a group of people. Its not that the group of people don't want to help,
  the reason is that they believe someone else is already at work and hence someone will take care of
  it. And concepts like _80/20 Rule_ , _20% of people do 80% of the work_.

I believe that everyone who reads the book, will enjoy and find _Tipping Point_ informative,
be it an entrepreneur starting a new business or a new graduate student looking for a job. It is a
great book for anyone who wants to spread a message or understand how behind the scenes, people and
situations work when something gets viral!
