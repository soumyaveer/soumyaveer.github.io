Books are a great source of learning, be it intellectual or emotional. At the beginning of every new year, I reflect on what I learnt last year and what were the major sources of those learning's. And just like every year, my answer is - **books**. Here are my top six favourite reads of last year.

### **Shoe Dog** by _Phil Knight_
_Shoe Dog_ is an impressive and motivating _memoir_ by founder of _NIKE_. Starting from, _Knight_ deciding to import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes, this book is full of risks and setbacks suffered by the company and Phil Knight. But in the end, due to the persistence and perseverance of the founder and people working for the company, NIKE becomes a brand and reaches the height of success.
  > There are many ways down Mt. Fuji, according to the guidebook, but only one way up." - Phil Knight (Shoe Dog)

I started this book thinking “It’s a memoir, might be a bit dry.” By the time I finished this book I realized how wrong I was. Not a moment in the book was dull and once you start reading, you just don't want to put it down. While reading Shoe Dog, I found myself smiling, taking mental notes and even sobbing at certain places. I was'nt just reading the book, I was living the experiences of Phil Knight. That’s how good the book is.


### **On Writing Well** by _William Zinsser_
In current era, one of the major forms of communication is writing - email, blogs (like this one), etc. My words reach where I can't. They represent me, what I am , what I stand for. The more I think about it, the more I realize, how important it is to explain myself clearly and concisely. Every day, I struggle to improve myself, seeking advice from the experts. If you are like me, this is a great book with some great advices. No matter in which industry you work, you'll find your answers related to _non-fictional writing_, right here in this book. As I found mine!

### **What If?** by _Randall Munroe_

### **The Book Thief** by _Markus Zuask_
_The Book Thief_ is the story of an orphan girl - _Liesel Meminger_. Set during the World WarII in Germany, it shows the courage of this orphan girl, her foster family, her neighbors and the jew hidden in her basement. Liesel has one true love - _books_, which forces her to become a _Book Thief_. She learns to read and her passion for books keeps the spirits of her family, friends and neighbors high during the fateful nights of air raids.

Even before picking this book up, I had high expectations from it beacuse I heard a lot of good reviews. And I must say that the book did not disappoint. Over a period of time while reading the book, you fall in love with all the characters, especially, Liesel and her foster father. What makes this book unique is that the whole story of Liesel Meminger is narrated by _Death!_

### **The Martian** by _Andy Weir_
What will you do, if you are stranded in the middle of nowhere? Maybe call for help! What if, that nowhere is planet Mars? _Astronaut Mark Watney_ says he'll try to colonize it. _The Martian_ is the story of _Astronaut Mark Watney_, who is accidentally, left behind on Mars (presumed dead), by his crew mates. Stranded on Mars, he fights for his survival, till someone discovers he is alive and help arrives. Will _Mark_ be able to leave Mars alive?

 There are a lot of scientific experiments and mishaps by _Watney_, but even in adversities, his character manages to humor the readers. If you have'nt read the book yet, give it a try, the book is really, really good.

### **Wonder** by _RJ Palacio_
_August Pullman_ is a 10 year old normal boy, except he has facial deformity, due to which he is home-schooled by his parents at home. The story begins when _Auggie's (August Pullman's)_ parents decide to send him to a school for the first time. Will _Auggie_ be able to adjust in his new school?
