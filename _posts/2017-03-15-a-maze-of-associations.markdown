summary: I find associations extremely fascinating, so decided to publish a post regarding Rails Associations. This post talks about the connection created by associations between two models, how they can be used, what methods user gets at his or her disposal, etc.

When I started learning rails, I was extremely confused in associations. They are like a maze in which you can get lost easily,
if you have not understood it properly. But when I understood associations I realized that they make our life easy when we are
trying to code in Rails.

Associations serve as link between models. For example, a Post is created by an Author. Fine! But how will Rails know that these
two models, Post and Author are related to each other. This is where Associations come into play.

That sounds great but how do they work? Before getting into that, Letâ€™s go ahead and see the types of associations.
There are four types of associations.
1. One-to-Many
2. One-to-one
3. Many-to-Many
4. Polymorphic one-to-many

Time to dive in and have a closer look at these associations:

1. **One-to-Many** : [One-to-Many](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-many-association) is one of
  the most commonly used association. It states that an instance of model has many instances of another model.
  For example, A student is enrolled in a University but a University has many students. We can say :
  _A University has_many students._
  _A student belongs_to a University._

  ```ruby
  class University < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :students
  end

  class Student < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :university
  end
  ```
  belongs_to is usually on the other side of has_many or has_one relationship and must be specified as singular.

  Once we establish _One-to-Many_ association, we get some very useful methods at our disposal:
  ..* university.students : name of students, enrolled in a university.
  ..* student.university : name of university student is enrolled in.
  ..* university.students << student : adds student to the collection.
  ..* university.students.delete(@student1) : deletes student1 from the collection. Sets foreign key to null.
  ..* university.students.destroy(@student1) : removes @student1 from collection by running destroy on each object.
  ..* university.students.build({ }) : instantiates a new student but does not save it.
  ..* university.students.create({ }) : validates and creates a new student and saves it in the database.
  ..* university.students.create!({}) : validates, creates and saves student in database, but returns the exception in case of failure.
  ..* university.build_student : instantiates a new student but does not save it.
  ..* university.create_student : creates a new student and saves it in the database.


2. **One-to-One** : [One-to-One](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-one-association)
  association states that one instance of model contains exactly one instance of other model.
 What that means is, for example A student enrolled in a university owns one University Account. We can say like this:
 _A student has_one Account_

 ```ruby
 class Student < ApplicationRecord
   has_one :account
 end

 class Account < ApplicationRecord
   belongs_to :student
 end
 ```
 After the relation is established, in _One-to-One_ as well we get few useful methods:
 ..* student.account - gets the account details for the student.
 ..* student.build_account - instantiates the new account but does not save it.
 ..* student.create_adress - validates, creates and saves new address to the database.

3. **Many-to-Many** : This association states that many instances of model has many instances of another model. It needs
a join table which stores the relation between the two models. Suppose we are saying
It can be set up in two ways :
..* _Has_And_Belongs_To_Many_ (HABTM) :
For example, Teachers teach many Students and Students are taught by many Teachers.
We can say it as :
  _Teachers has_many Students_
  _Students has_many Teachers_

In this case the join table name by default will be _students_teachers_

 ```ruby
 class Teacher < ApplicationRecord
   has_and_belongs_to_many :students
 end

 class Student < ApplicationRecord
   has_and_belongs_to_many :teachers
 end
 ```
 Now, with the establishment of HABTM relation, we get another set of methods to play around with:
 ..* student.teachers: All teachers teaching a particular student
 ..* student.teacher_ids: returns ids from the colection
 ..* student.teacher_ids = [1, 2, 3] : creates collection with objects corresponding to PK values supplied.
 ..* student.teachers.delete(teacher_1) or student.teachers.destroy(teacher_1): Deletes or Destroys the relations for teacher_1
 ..* teachers.empty? : checks if teachers contains data
 ..* teachers.size : checs the size of teachers collection
 ..* student.teachers.create(attributes = {}): creates and adds objects to the collection

HABTM is an approach which definitely looks easy, but it is a very rigid in the sense that we gain almost no flexibility
of wokring with the relationship model independently. This problem is solved using _Has Many Through_ relation.

..* Has Many Through : This is a more flexible approach under _many_to_many_ relation. Lets take an example and see what it means.
Let us say that Students in a university are to be sent many reminders for events and each event has many students attending it.
We can say:
    _Students has_many Reminders_
    _Reminders can be sent to many Students_

    ```ruby
    class Student < ApplicationRecord
      has_many :students_reminders
      has_many :reminders, through: :students_reminders
    end

    class StudentsReminder < ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :students
      belongs_to :reminders
    end

    class Reminder < ApplicationRecord
      has_many :students_reminders
      has_many :students, through: :students_reminders
    end
    ```

4. Polymorphic one-to-many: In this type of association, the model might belong to more than one other models,
   on a single association.
