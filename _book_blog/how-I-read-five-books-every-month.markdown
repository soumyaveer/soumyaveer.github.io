Reading is not just my hobby but more of a passion. Over a couple of years, I have read a lot of books. Some of the books are for entertainment, and some for pure relaxation. Many people have asked me how I can read over five plus books every month. So here is a post answering this question for anyone who wants to know.<br><br>

**Don’t set a target every month.** Reading is my hobby. I don’t want to do it under pressure. It is a way to relax my mind, so I want it to be fun. I start every month tentatively looking at what I am in a mood for versus what books will be returned to my local library in the next two weeks. I pick up loaned books that are about to expire first, and then whatever I want to read. Nothing sucks out the fun of an activity than doing it competitively. So, no competitive reading for me!

**Read things that interest you.** This one is important. I read books that interest me. If you don’t like the book you are reading, you’ll drop it like hot potatoes. So if one of your goals is to start reading or reading more books, ONLY pick books that can keep you engaged. For example, if Literature is not your genre, drop it, and don’t do it under peer pressure.

**Set your phone on DND mode.** I always put my phone on DND while reading. I find notifications distracting, so I try to minimize them during my reading sprints. The only app I use while reading is mostly Libby - the library I use to download books and audiobooks.

**Set up a time and a ritual around reading.** I have tied my reading time with my evening and night routines. In the evenings, I create an ambiance, turn on the fireplace, light the scented candles, grab a cup of coffee and a blanket, and I am set to read for an hour or so. I also have a nighttime wind-down ritual; reading is part of it. This also helps me stay away from my phone just before going to bed.

**Be flexible about the formats.** I don’t have any reservations about reading any format. I also don’t believe that there is just one kind of reading. I grab any opportunity to read at any time and in any form. Here are the three formats and their benefits.

1. **Ebooks** - I own a Kindle. It is one of my favorite purchases. I like to travel light, so I can’t carry more than one physical book. That is where having a Kindle helps. I download books I might want to read and carry them in my backpack. You will never find me without my Kindle. Whether waiting in the doctor's office or traveling, this device is small enough to pull out and read anywhere. Much of my reading is done because of the ease of access. No opportunity is wasted. The good thing about ebooks is that you can read them on any device; you don’t have to restrict yourself o Kindle.

2. **Audiobooks** - Another format that I enjoy is audiobooks. Again, one of the significant benefits is portability. Download the app on your phone, and you can listen to the audiobook anywhere and while doing anything - driving a car, washing dishes, cooking, you name it. This is a convenient format. Adding to it the benefit of speeding or slowing down the narration speed according to your comfort level.

3. **Physical books** - Despite having Kindle, I love reading actual books. When I am in the mood to relax at home, I always pick up my physical copy of the books.

**Mix the formats.** I don’t usually stick with one format at a time. Suppose I am reading a book in ebook format and get up to do some work; I turn my audiobook on while completing the chore and then return to the book. That way, I can continue the story even while doing something else. Other times, I read the book and listen to the audiobook simultaneously. It keeps me from getting distracted and helps me focus on the story.

**Don’t try to start and finish the same book at a stretch.** Reading different books simultaneously and splitting them according to the mood works wonders for me. You might find me reading 3 - 4 books at a time. Which book I read depends on what kind of mood I am in. For example, if I want to relax, I might pick up a Young Adult genre and read for a bit, and then in a few hours, I am in a mood for learning and growth, then I might pick up a self-help book or any non-fiction book.

I started off struggling to find time to read books. But over the years, I realized that to cultivate any habit, you have to make the path as smooth as possible. These are some things I do to make my path to reading more books smoother. And I hope these will help you if that is one of your goals.
