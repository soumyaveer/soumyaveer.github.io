In this post I am sharing some of the best **Non-Fiction** books I read in year 2018. All these books are rated **5 stars** by me. 

### Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body - _Roxane Gay_

 In this book _Roxane Gay_ talks about her journey and how one incident changed the shape of her life. I learnt a lot from her journey about psychological struggles, self-care, self-love and society. Even though there are many good people, our society setup is cruel. It tries to fit everyone in a box and when they refuse to abide by the standards, they are punished for it in small little ways till they fall into submission. It is time we get more sensitive and accept everyone no matter who they are. 

  I think that this book is a must read for everyone. I could not have understood the feelings of people who are suffering. This book made me more sensitive towards them.

### Mindset: The New Psychology of Success - _Carol S. Dweck_

Why do some people people succeed and others don't? What is the mindset of successful people?  This book answers all these questions and many more. _Carol S Dweck_ a psychologist from _Stanford University_ reveals the idea of - _the power of mindset_. She talks about two kinds of mindsets - **Fixed mindset** and **Growth mindset**. 
	
People with _fixed mindset_ believe that their abilities are fixed. They believe that  there is no point in working hard towards something that you don't have a talent for. Whereas, people with _growth mindset_  believe that anything can be learned or achieved with practice. They believe that abilities can be developed. _Carol S Dweck_ urges people to create a growth mindset in order to succeed.

### GRIT - _Angela Duckworth_

Another book which centers around what skills to develop in order to succeed in life.  _Angela Duckworth_, a professor of psychology in University of Pennsylvania shows that the secret of success is not talent but _grit_ or in other words _focused persistence_. She talks about her life and interviews she had with highly successful people, illustrating the common element in their stories - _perseverance_ and _grit_. She shares a quick quiz to determine your grit level and talks about how perseverance
and grit can be practiced and improved over time.

### The Art of War - _Sun Tzu_

In 500 B.C. _Sun Tzu_ wrote this book based on  Chinese warfare military strategy. This book has been read and re-read since then. The teachings of _Sun Tzu_ to gain advantage over opponents can be applied in any field of life be it warfare or everyday life. 

### Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI - _David Grann_

![Killers of the Flower Moon]({{ "/assets/images/my-favorite-non-fictional-books-of-2018/killers_of_the_flower_moon.jpeg" }})

Based on real events, this book is a real life crime thriller. After the discovery of oil in Oklahoma, _Osage_ became the richest Indian tribe. This triggered a series of murders over years. _Mollie Burkhart_ witnessed the killings of her family members. Anyone who investigated these murders, also started dying under mysterious circumstances. Until  _Tom White_ put together FBI and started investigating these crimes, which later revealed to be one of the biggest conspiracy in American history.
