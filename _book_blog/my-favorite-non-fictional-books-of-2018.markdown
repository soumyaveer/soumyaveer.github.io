  ### Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body - _Roxane Gay_
  
  This book completely destroyed me. In this book _Roxane Gay_ talks about her journey and how one incident affected and changed the complete course of her life. I learnt a lot from her journey about psychological struggles, self-care, self-love and society. Even though there are many good people, they way our overall society is setup is cruel. It tries to fit everyone in a box and when they refuse to abide by the standards, they are punished for it in small little ways till they fall into submission. It is time we get more sensitive and accept everyone no matter who they are. 

  I think that this book is a must read for everyone. Especially if you have not gone through these experiences. It will make you senstive towards those who have suffered.
