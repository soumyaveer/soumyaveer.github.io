Continuing with **My favorite books of 2018**, here comes my second blog, which talks about the series I read and loved in 2018. These are the books I highly recommend. There was no way to select which series I loved most among these five mentioned below. The sequence in which they are in the post do not represent my preference.

### Illuminae/ Gemina/ Obsidio -  *Amie Kaufman & Jay Kristoff*
#### Rating -  5 star

  ![Illuminae Files]({{ "/assets/images/my-fav-book-series-of-2018/illuminae.jpg" }})


  **Illuminae Files** was the best _science fiction -  space opera_ I read in 2018. It starts with **Illuminae**. Set in year 2575, the series is about a battle between two major corporations. The story starts with *Kady Grant and Ezra Mason* fleeing for their lives  as their planet _Kerenza_ is attacked by _BeiTech corporation_. In the next book **Gemina**, we follow the story of _Hanna & Nick_ who live on the jump station _Heimdall_. _Kady & Ezra's_ space craft _Hypatia_ is headed towards _Heimdall_ with the news of _Kerenza_ invasion. But _Bietech corporation_ strikes before _Hypatia_ could reach _Heimdall_. **Obsidio** is the grand finale to this exciting space opera.

  If you want some space drama and adventure, this is the series for you. This book is full of action and is sprinkled with romance throughout. I usually don't like reading _romance genere_, but this book handled it very well. For me **Illuminae Files** was also a refreshing change from the normal book format. The series is in form of official dossiers, instant messages, voice and video recordings, and sketches.
  
  My favorite character in the series was _AIDAN_. Short for Artificial Intelligence Defense Analytics Network. AIDAN is a complete psycho, but also an adorable AI(Artificial Intelligence). Other than AIDAN, I loved the character of _Kady Grant_ and _Hannah Donnely_. Kady is a hacker. It is interesting to see how she utilizes her skills in order to save her people. Hannah is trained from childhood in the art of combat by her father. Noone can match her intellect and strategic planning.

  If you have not read this series, go ahead and try it now. I read the book. I have heard great things about the audiobook as well. Whatever format you choose, I highly recommend this series.


### The Diviners/ Lair of Dreams/ Before The Devil Breaks You - *Libba Bray*
#### Rating - 5 star

  ![The Diviners]({{ "/assets/images/my-fav-book-series-of-2018/diviners.jpg" }})

  If you _love horror and occult_, this is the book for you. I usually don't enjoy horror, but I loved this series. Starting with bizarre murders, this book turned into something very dark and creepy. The descriptions were extremely visual and the murder scenes were spine chilling (thinking about them still give me goose bumps). I loved all the characters in the book, along with their faults, their pasts and their dark secrets. 
  
  **The Diviners** was a great introduction to the series. It started with supernatural murders and the investigation by _Evie O’Neill_ & her uncle _Will_. This is followed by **Lair of dreams**. Here _Evie O’Neill_ and her friends try to solve the mystrey of a strange sickness enveloping New York city - the sickness of never coming out of dreams. And finally, **Before the devil breaks you** started with an asylum and the creepy things happening in it. _Evie_ and her friends try to investigate, but this time something much more evil and powerful is at work. This book is a beginning to the grand finale. The series is still not over. I am still waiting for the fourth and the final book to release.
    
  Another reason that I loved this series was that *January LaVoy* (the narrator) has done a wonderful job. She got all the characters and the creepy murders to life. Her narration affected me so deeply that I stopped listening to this series at night before going to bed. I do not recommend this book to people who don’t like horror or have overactive imagination. But if you love or can at least tolerate horror, then you must read this book. As _Evie_ would say - "This book is pos-i-tute-ly creepy!". 

### Six of Crows / Crocked Kingdom - *Leigh Bardugo*
#### Rating - 5 star

  ![Six of Crows]({{ "/assets/images/my-fav-book-series-of-2018/six_of_crows.jpg" }})

**Six of crows** is full of action, adventure and twists in plot. *Kaz Brekker* is given a job to pull off the biggest heist in the history. For this job he gathers a crew of six people -  _a convict, a sharpshooter, a runaway, a spy, a heartrender (people with magic to manipulate flesh and blood) and a thief_.  Following this heist attempt in the **Crocked Kingdom** _Kaz and his crew_ have to wage a war for their lives, for survival and for all they love.  _Crocked Kingdom_ is a wonderful finale to the first book and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 
    
I loved all the characters, especially - _Kaz and Inej_.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure. You can expect the unexpected from this series.


### Lord Of The Rings (Fellowship of the ring/ The two towers/ The return of the king) - *J.R.R Tolkin*
#### Rating - 5 star

  ![Lord of the rings]({{ "/assets/images/my-fav-book-series-of-2018/lord_of_the_rings.jpg" }})

Lord of the rings is hands down my favorite movie. Now, the book is also one of my favorites. The journey of _Frodo Baggins_ from the rolling  green hills of _Shire_ to the heart of evil at _Mordor_  is as adventurous to me (everytime I read or watch the movies) as it was the first time.

**Fellowship of the ring** starts with a hobbit _Frodo Baggins_ inheriting a ring, which was in possession of his uncle _Bilbo Baggins_. This ring has powers. It is an evil ring (_"One ring to rule them all"_) and has its own will. The ring's will is to return to its master _Sauron_, who was the evil defeated years ago by a human king. The responsibility of delivering this ring safely to the _King of Elves_ falls on _Frodo's_ shoulders. But the path is not easy, the dark forces have already stirred. _Frodo_ must endure mortal and immortal wounds and display courage to complete this mission. 

**The Two Towers** is next in this series. In this book _Frodo_ begins another journey with the eight other brave companions. The mission is to destroy the ring in the volcanos of _Mordor_, where it was forged. But the ring has the history of corrupting men, women, wizards, dwarfs and elves. In the midst of evil, should Frodo trust his companions?

**The Return of the King** is the third and the final book in the series. In this book _Frodo_ continues his journey to destroy the ring. If he fails, evil will prevail and all will be lost! 

For this one, I listened to the dramatized audiobook which had a cast of characters and sound tracks. If you ask me what I love most about this book, I will say it is difficult for me to pick. I love each and every character. Lord of the rings is to me what Harry Potter is to most people. 

### A Darker Shade of Magic/ A Gathering of Shadows/ A Conjuring of Light - *VE Schwab*
#### Rating - 5 star

  ![A darker shade of magic]({{ "/assets/images/my-fav-book-series-of-2018/a-darker-shade-of-magic.png" }})


The final series on this list is **A darker shade of magic**. The story is about four London’s in parallel universes - _grey, red, white and black_. _Grey London_ is one without magic, _Red London_ is thriving with magic, _White London_ has very little magic and _Black London_  is completly destroyed by magic. Only an _Antari_ (distinguished by one black eye) has the power to travel through different Londons. There are only two _Antari's_ left in all the four worlds, one of whom is _Kell_. 

_Kell_ serves the _Maresh Empire_, the family ruling the _Red London_. He is a messenger who takes messages from the kings of different london and delivers them to his king. Most people in this world can control only one or at max three elements. But, _Kell_ being one of the most powerful magicians can control all elements - _Earth, Air, Water, Metal and Bone_. During one of his trips, _Kell_ smuggles an item and unwittingly triggers a threat to _Red London_. A threat which can destroy it completely. Will _Kell_ be able to save his London? And what sacrifices will he and his people have to make for it? 

I loved all the characters of this book especially _Kell_ and _Lila_. At the end of the book, I wished the book never got over. But all good things must end and so did this book.


I read a lot of series this year, but the once mentioned above were my top five picks. Coming up next -  **[My favorite non-fiction books of 2018](https://www.soumyathinks.com/personal/books/my-favorite-non-fictional-books-of-2018)**. Till then, have fun reading!!!
