Technology has changed our lives, for better or for worse. We have more time on our hands and more ways to waste it. Think about it. We have a car; we can get to work in 15 minutes compared to when people used to walk for one hour. We buy everything online, from groceries to our favorite dresses. Then why do we feel exhausted at the end of the day? Weren't we sitting in front of the laptop the whole day? The answer is that - "Energy and time are limited resources.” We waste most of it scrolling social media on our mobiles. The rest of the relaxation time is spent on TV. By the end of the day, we are mentally and physically exhausted. That can't be right. Is there a way out of this? Fortunately, there is a way out - Reading!

Reading helps you nourish your mind, body, and soul. It helps in achieving goals that you have set for yourself - professional and personal. How? Let's dive into it.

### Nourish your mind - Reading helps advance your career.

**Increase knowledge**

One thing that separates Homo sapiens from other species is language. Language is the basis of all communications. We are the only species that can read, learn and pass on information to future generations.

Acquiring knowledge is the most obvious benefit of reading. The more we read, the more we accumulate knowledge. The more knowledge we collect, the more we can apply that learning to work and life.

**Strengthen critical and analytical skills**

Like we train the muscles in our body by going to the gym, we can also train the muscles of our brain by reading. How? Ever read a mystery novel and tried to solve it before the perpetrator is revealed? Great! That was the application of analytical and critical skills. This practice allows us to take the jumbled-up information and arrange it chronologically. This is an essential skill in your day-to-day life, especially for professional success.

**Improves communication skills**

Reading improves vocabulary. When we read, we explore new words, which, when used often or seen often, become a part of our vocabulary.Ever been in a situation where you can't find words to explain yourself? Having a good vocabulary will help us navigate such situations smoothly. People who have better vocabularies can articulate and express themselves better. Research shows that people who have good communication skills get promotions faster.

**Improves written skills**

Written communication is one of the most essential skills to have these days. All communications happen via email or messengers like Slack. Reading helps us improve the way we think and craft our writing. When we read a book, we can study and analyze how the author’s writing style and try to simulate that. We can read books that teach us the art of fictional or non-fictional writing, like - "On writing well: an informal guide to writing nonfiction by William Zinsser."

**Improves focus and concentration**

Research shows that the brain gets distracted in about 5-10 minutes. Sounds familiar? Yeah! I have been there too. But the good news is that we can train ourselves to focus more and concentrate better by reading books. When reading a book, our complete attention is focused on the book. This helps train the brain to concentrate for longer hours. Reading 20 - 30 minutes every day improves concentration!

### Nourish your body - Reading helps you live healthier and fight off brain diseases.

**Improves memory**

Like reading improves focus and concentration, it also improves memory. When we read a book, we stop and reflect on the content. We remember plots and subplots, characters, and their histories. This improves memory and helps fight diseases like Alzheimer's and Dementia.

**Reduces stress and anxiety**

Everyone has good and bad days. Reading offers us a way to replace negative thoughts with the book's content. We can pick up a motivational book or lose ourselves in the world of fiction. It gives us a safe place to harbor till stress and anxiety pass and we return to our usual cheerful selves.

**Helps you sleep well**

Doctors say engaging in devices like TV, mobile or tablets before sleeping is unsuitable for health. It disrupts our circadian rhythm, which in turn results in poor health and impacts productivity. So what is the alternative? One of the alternatives is to engage yourself in a book half an hour before sleeping. It helps to make reading a bedtime ritual. Reading pushes away the day's worries, and we can get a good night's rest without the light from our devices disturbing our Circadian Rhythm.

**Increases your lifespan**

Research says that adults who read for at least three and a half hours per week have longer lifespans. Reading increases connectivity between brain cells, lowering the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. So, if you want to live a healthy and long life, read every day for half an hour.

### Nourish your soul - Reading makes you a kinder and a more competent person

**Boosts inspiration and motivation**

"You are the average of five people around you." Reading books helps us surround ourselves with the people we aspire to learn from. These people may not be reachable in person, but they are reachable via books. We can learn from the experience of the masters,  apply those in our lives and grow.

**Stimulates imagination**

While reading a book, you can set your imagination free, build new worlds and see the characters as you imagine. It keeps evolving as and when the description changes. Believe it or not, this makes our creative brain work much more than it does when we watch the adaptation of the same book on TV. There is a reason people rarely like book adaptations, and this is it.

**Increases empathy levels**

Ah! This is my favorite point. People always ask me - "What is the use of reading fiction?" Here is your answer. Fiction improves our empathy levels. While reading, we get introduced to different characters. Depending on the book's plot, these characters have their journeys, highs, and lows. This allows us to feel what the character in the story feels, which makes us understand other people's emotions. Being in someone else's shoes helps understand their perspective.

**Improves helps in making the right decisions**

Reading makes us a better-informed person. The more informed we are, the more informed decisions we can take. It improves our reading comprehension and emotional intelligence. As a result, we can make better decisions in our professional and personal life.

### A constant source of companionship.

"Man is a social animal." We, humans, crave constant companionship. Imagine being alone the whole day and having no one to talk to. Yes! I have been there.

I am sharing my personal experience here. Moving to the United States after marriage was a challenging experience for me. Till my husband was at home, I was happy as a cricket, but when he left for work, it was me and the walls. I was left alone in the house with no one to talk to and nowhere to go. What was the solution to this problem? I resolved this by getting myself a library card. I picked up "Imagining India - by Nandan Nilekani.” Since then, I have been in the company of Nandan Nilekeni, JK Rowling, Daniel Kahneman, and all the knowledgeable authors, learning from their experiences. I don't feel lonely anymore! Reading reduces feelings of loneliness. Emotional connection with characters in a book we read provides companionship. And these are just a few benefits of reading.
