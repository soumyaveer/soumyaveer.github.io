<h3 id="hunger-a-memoir-of-my-body---roxane-gay">Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body - <em>Roxane Gay</em></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/my-favorite-non-fictional-books-of-2018/hunger.jpeg" alt="Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body" /></p>

<p>In this book <em>Roxane Gay</em> talks about her journey and how one incident changed the shape of her life. I learnt a lot from her journey about psychological struggles, self-care, self-love and society. Even though there are many good people, our society setup is cruel. It tries to fit everyone in a box and when they refuse to abide by the standards, they are punished for it in small little ways till they fall into submission. It is time we get more sensitive and accept everyone no matter who they are.</p>

<p>I think that this book is a must read for everyone. I could not have understood the feelings of people who are suffering. This book made me more sensitive towards them.</p>

<h3 id="mindset-the-new-psychology-of-success---carol-s-dweck">Mindset: The New Psychology of Success - <em>Carol S. Dweck</em></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/my-favorite-non-fictional-books-of-2018/mindset.jpg" alt="Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" /></p>

<p>Why do some people people succeed and others don’t? What is the mindset of successful people?  This book answers all these questions and many more. <em>Carol S Dweck</em> a psychologist from <em>Stanford University</em> reveals the idea of - <em>the power of mindset</em>. She talks about two kinds of mindsets - <strong>Fixed mindset</strong> and <strong>Growth mindset</strong>.</p>

<p>People with <em>fixed mindset</em> believe that their abilities are fixed. They believe that  there is no point in working hard towards something that you don’t have a talent for. Whereas, people with <em>growth mindset</em>  believe that anything can be learned or achieved with practice. They believe that abilities can be developed. <em>Carol S Dweck</em> urges people to create a growth mindset in order to succeed.</p>

<h3 id="grit---angela-duckworth">GRIT - <em>Angela Duckworth</em></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/my-favorite-non-fictional-books-of-2018/grit.jpg" alt="GRIT" /></p>

<p>Another book which centers around what skills to develop in order to succeed in life.  <em>Angela Duckworth</em>, a professor of psychology in University of Pennsylvania shows that the secret of success is not talent but <em>grit</em> or in other words <em>focused persistence</em>. She talks about her life and interviews she had with highly successful people, illustrating the common element in their stories - <em>perseverance</em> and <em>grit</em>. She shares a quick quiz to determine your grit level and talks about how perseverance
and grit can be practiced and improved over time.</p>

<h3 id="the-art-of-war---sun-tzu">The Art of War - <em>Sun Tzu</em></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/my-favorite-non-fictional-books-of-2018/the_art_of_war.jpeg" alt="The Art of War" /></p>

<p>In 500 B.C. <em>Sun Tzu</em> wrote this book based on  Chinese warfare military strategy. This book has been read and re-read since then. The teachings of <em>Sun Tzu</em> to gain advantage over opponents can be applied in any field of life be it warfare or everyday life.</p>

<h3 id="killers-of-the-flower-moon-the-osage-murders-and-the-birth-of-the-fbi---david-grann">Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI - <em>David Grann</em></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/my-favorite-non-fictional-books-of-2018/killers_of_the_flower_moon.jpeg" alt="Killers of the Flower Moon" /></p>

<p>Based on real events, this book is a real life crime thriller. After the discovery of oil in Oklahoma, <em>Osage</em> became the richest Indian tribe. This triggered a series of murders over years. <em>Mollie Burkhart</em> witnessed the killings of her family members. Anyone who investigated these murders, also started dying under mysterious circumstances. Until  <em>Tom White</em> put together FBI and started investigating these crimes, which later revealed to be one of the biggest conspiracy in American history.</p>
