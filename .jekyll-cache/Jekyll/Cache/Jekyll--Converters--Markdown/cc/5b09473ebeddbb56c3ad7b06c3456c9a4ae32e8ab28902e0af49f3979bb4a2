I"Ô<p>The <strong>Stylecheck</strong> gem provides a bunch of rake tasks to run code style checks.
Currently it supports <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ruby</code> (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rubocop</code>) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCSS</code> (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scss-lint</code>). I will be adding more
languages to it very soon. Typically one would hook it up to CI to run it along with the application tests.
One shortcoming of this approach is that unlike HoundCI it runs checks on all included files, not just the
changed ones.
