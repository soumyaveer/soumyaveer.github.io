I"	<p>My earliest memories of childhood is sitting in front of a computer, staring at the black screen and typing  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forward 100</code>. In case you are wondering, what I was trying to do. I was 10 years old, working on <strong>LOGO</strong> programming.</p>

<p>I was interested in coding, even as a child. By the end of my high school, I learnt <strong>C</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> languages. But when it came to choosing a branch for my undergraduate degree I decided to take up <em>Electronics and Communications Engineering</em>, for a very simple reason - my family members were Electronics Engineers. A major part of Curriculum in Electronics covers programming skills like - <strong>Assembly languages</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Data structures in C++</strong>. I aced these courses during my undergraduate degree, resulting in my getting a job offer from a <em>software firm</em>, which I joined as a <em>full time employee</em> and <em>worked for three years</em>. During this time I worked on <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Unix</strong> and <strong>PL/SQL</strong>.</p>

<p>Very early in life I learnt the lesson that only constant thing in life is change! One has to keep moving and learning new things. Stagnant water is not fit for drinking but, the flowing river water is. And so I decided to move on to the next phase, which was applying for <em>Masters at University of Houston</em>. But as they say “Old habits die hard”. When it came to the decision , I chose <em>Electrical Engineering</em>. During these two years, I enjoyed the fact that I was not only capable of taking hardware responsibilities for the projects, but was also able to execute the software responsibilities successfully.</p>

<p>After completing my masters, I entered a new phase in my life. I got married to a Software Engineer. Everyday, I used to watch him working on his laptop - carefully writing the tests, coding the requirements. One day as I was watching him work, I realized that he was not coding. He was teaching the machine what to do and how to do it. It was like teaching a child and watching him grow into something beautiful and strong. That triggered my interests and I decided that I wanted to be a Software Developer.</p>
