<p>There are many ways of gaining knowledge, but the one I like most is - <strong>Reading a Book!</strong> When I started this project, I wanted to create something that will be helpful in enhancing knowledge by reading. Being a passionate book lover, I decided that an application which gives the current available book deals will be an interesting project to work on. And this idea resulted in the creation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem book-deals</code>.</p>

<p><em>What is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">book-deals</code>?</em>  It is a gem which displays books with discounted prices on Goodreads website.</p>

<p>The main focus while implementing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">book-deals</code> was <em>creating a gem</em> (The gem can be installed by following the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code> document provided with documentation.) and following <em>Object Oriented Programming</em> principles.</p>

<p>From users point of view, it was important to look into the <em>ease of usability</em> aspect. To conquer this, I made sure, that every step while executing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">book-deals</code> is guided with helpful messages and color coded instructions.</p>

<p>Once, the user executes the program, he/she is greeted with a <em>Welcome screen</em> followed by a <em>menu</em>. This menu contains a list of categories to select from.
