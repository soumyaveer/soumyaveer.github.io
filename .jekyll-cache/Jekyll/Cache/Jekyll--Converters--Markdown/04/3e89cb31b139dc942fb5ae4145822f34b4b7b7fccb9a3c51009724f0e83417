I"`<p><strong>Trivia Zone</strong> is an application that allows playing and creating trivias and compete for the top three positions on the Leaderboard. (Read more about <strong>TriviaZone</strong> <a href="http://www.soumyathinks.com/main/2017/12/03/trivia-zone-a-fun-way-of-testing-your-knowledge.html">here</a>).
It was fun developing TriviaZone, but my end goals for working on these projects are - learning and improving the user experience. So I enhanced the application to implement what I learned in <em>Javascript</em> &amp; <em>Jquery</em> and hence, improve the overall experience of the end user.</p>

<p>From user’s point of view, enhancements, upgrades these features:</p>
<ol>
  <li>User can create new topic and see it on the same page.</li>
  <li>Along with the new topic, user can also see number of trivias in each topic.</li>
  <li>User now gets the page in HTML, as well as JSON formats.</li>
  <li>User can see the results and feedback of next and previous played trivias by clicking on the next and previous links of the results page.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main challenges that I came across while working on this project were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Finding the next and previous played trivias data to allow smooth navigation. This was handled by adding an attribute in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Serializer</code> to hold next and previous data.</li>
  <li>Loading of all JavaScript files and thus, getting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undefined id</code> errors for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get</code> requests while loading other pages. This was handled by writing <em>page-specific JavaScript</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nothing is more fun than working on challenges and nothing gives more joy than overcoming those challenges. The fact that I was able to overcome the challenges, achieve the goal of making end user’s experience smooth and yet again, learn a lot from <strong>TriviaZone</strong> project makes me very happy!</p>
