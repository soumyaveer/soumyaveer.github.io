<p>Recently I came across a theory which says â€œWe are average of five people in our closest
inner circleâ€. So I chose five people in my inner circle by choosing the authors of my
favorite books, which I will love to share with you. So here are some great books that
I read in the year 2016!</p>

<h3 id="the-design-of-everyday-things-by-dr-donald-a-norman"><strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong> by <em>Dr. Donald A Norman</em></h3>
<p>Ever got stuck outside an unlocked door of a building? You tried everything but the
door did not budge, and suddenly you saw someone walking through the same door.
This is when you realize that the place where you were trying to enter was not a door
at all, its a wall of glass. The door is a little further ahead. You missed it because
the door somehow managed to camouflage itself with the glass wall! What did you feel at
that time? Embarrassed for messing up on something as simple as a door? Oh well, Donâ€™t be.
Dr. Norman says itâ€™s not your fault, itâ€™s the fault of the doorâ€™s design.</p>

<p><em>The Design of everyday things</em> is a book which describes the principles of cognitive
psychology and influence of good and bad designs on consumer behavior. Dr. Norman states
in the book how the design of simple things such as - a door or light switches, should
come without a user manual or memorization of procedures. The primary motive of any
product should be the ease of use rather than its aestheticsâ€™s. The book stresses on the
topics like - how a badly designed equipment can harm the person operating it or lack
of feedback can completely baffle the consumers. It plunges into details of psychology
of everyday actions and design challenges. This is a highly recommended book especially
for engineers, because it gives useful insights on the design principles and urges the
reader to think more creatively about the design flaws in products.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman"><strong>Thinking Fast and Slow</strong> by <em>Daniel Kahneman</em></h3>
<p><em>Cognitive Psychology</em>, <em>Cognitive Biases</em>, <em>Halo Effect</em>, <em>Anchoring Effect</em>,
<em>Hedonic Psychology</em>. Oh my god! What in the world is happening here? This is exactly
 how you will NOT feel while reading this book. Yes, I said not!</p>

<p>After reading <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> you will truly be able to understand how choices
 are made by us in our professional or personal lives. There are a lot factors influencing
 our decisions. In this book Dr. Kahneman takes us on a tour of <em>Human Irrationality</em>
 and introduces us to two main systems at work. <em>System1</em> which is fast, intuitive and
 emotional. <em>System2</em>  which is slower and more logical.
 Complete the phrase â€œbread and â€¦.â€ - thatâ€™s <em>System1</em> at work.
 Count the occurrences of letter â€˜aâ€™ in the next page - that is our <em>System2</em>.
 Dr. Kahneman talks about all the topics mentioned above from <em>Human Irrationality</em> to
 <em>Hedonic Psychology</em> in a very interesting and conversational tone. This book is not
 only full of information but also contains lot of practical life case studies.
 It also involves the reader in fun activities, for example, try this â€˜Hold a pencil
 horizontally in your mouth and leave it there for some timeâ€™. Any idea what happens
 after a few minutes? You start feeling happy! Donâ€™t believe me? Go ahead and try
 it yourself.</p>

<p>â€œTo err is to humanâ€. As human beings, we are susceptible to mistakes.
This holds true even for software programmers. Some mistakes are grave and put us in
extremely difficult situations like messed up piece of code or a poorly captured requirement,
which can be avoided. In situations such as these we need a friend or a mentor who can give us
some valuable advices. The Pragmatic Programmer is one such friend.</p>

<p>Ranging from topics like importance of
<em>writing the clean code</em> to <em>team management</em> this book covers some very important
aspects and principles of software development. It stresses on the importance of
writing <em>reusable code</em>, <em>DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) Principle</em>, <em>avoid writing code by
coincidence</em>, <em>effectiveness of good testing</em> and also discusses the <em>significance of
getting clear requirements</em>. This book imparts a lot of information and major pitfalls
, explained using practical real life examples. If you are new in the field of
software programming, this book will be a mentor to guide you through the learning
process, giving lessons to remember for life. If you are an experienced programmer

<h3 id="sophies-world-by-jostein-gardner"><strong>Sophieâ€™s World</strong> by <em>Jostein Gardner</em></h3>
