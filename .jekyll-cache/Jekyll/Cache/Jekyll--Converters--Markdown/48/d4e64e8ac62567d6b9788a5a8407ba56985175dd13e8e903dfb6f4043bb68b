I"°'<p>Continuing with <strong>My favorite books of 2018</strong>, here comes my second blog, which talks about the series I read and loved in 2018. These are the books I highly recommend. There was no way to select which series I loved most among these five mentioned below. The sequence in which they are in the post do not represent my preference.</p>

<h3 id="illuminae-gemina-obsidio----amie-kaufman--jay-kristoff">Illuminae/ Gemina/ Obsidio -  <em>Amie Kaufman &amp; Jay Kristoff</em></h3>
<h4 id="rating----5-star">Rating -  5 star</h4>

<p><strong>Illuminae Files</strong> was the best <em>science fiction -  space opera</em> I read in 2018. It starts with <strong>Illuminae</strong>. Set in year 2575, the series is about a battle between two major corporations. The story starts with <em>Kady Grant and Ezra Mason</em> fleeing for their lives  as their planet <em>Kerenza</em> is attacked by <em>BeiTech corporation</em>. In the next book <strong>Gemina</strong>, we follow the story of <em>Hanna &amp; Nick</em> who live on the jump station <em>Heimdall</em>. <em>Kady &amp; Ezra‚Äôs</em> space craft <em>Hypatia</em> is headed towards <em>Heimdall</em> with the news of <em>Kerenza</em> invasion. But <em>Bietech corporation</em> strikes before <em>Hypatia</em> could reach <em>Heimdall</em>. <strong>Obsidio</strong> is the grand finale to this exciting space opera.</p>

<p>If you want some space drama and adventure, this is the series for you. This book is full of action and is sprinkled with romance throughout. I usually don‚Äôt like reading <em>romance genere</em>, but this book handled it very well. For me <strong>Illuminae Files</strong> was also a refreshing change from the normal book format. The series is in form of official dossiers, instant messages, voice and video recordings, and sketches.</p>

<p>My favorite character in the series was <em>AIDAN</em>. Short for Artificial Intelligence Defense Analytics Network. AIDAN is a complete psycho, but also an adorable AI(Artificial Intelligence). Other than AIDAN, I loved the character of <em>Kady Grant</em> and <em>Hannah Donnely</em>. Kady is a hacker. It is interesting to see how she utilizes her skills in order to save her people. Hannah is trained from childhood in the art of combat by her father. Noone can match her intellect and strategic planning.</p>

<p>If you have not read this series, go ahead and try it now. I read the book. I have heard great things about the audiobook as well. Whatever format you choose, I highly recommend this series.</p>

<h4 id="rating---5-star">Rating - 5 star</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/my-fav-book-series-of-2018/diviners.jpg" alt="The Diviners" /></p>

<p>If you <em>love horror and occult</em>, this is the book for you. I usually don‚Äôt enjoy horror, but I loved this series. Starting with bizarre murders, this book turned into something very dark and creepy. The descriptions were extremely visual and the murder scenes were spine chilling (thinking about them still give me goose bumps). I loved all the characters in the book, along with their faults, their pasts and their dark secrets.</p>

<p><strong>The Diviners</strong> was a great introduction to the series. It started with supernatural murders and the investigation by <em>Evie O‚ÄôNeill</em> &amp; her uncle <em>Will</em>. This is followed by <strong>Lair of dreams</strong>. Here <em>Evie O‚ÄôNeill</em> and her friends try to solve the mystrey of a strange sickness enveloping New York city - the sickness of never coming out of dreams. And finally, <strong>Before the devil breaks you</strong> started with an asylum and the creepy things happening in it. <em>Evie</em> and her friends try to investigate, but this time something much more evil and powerful is at work. This book is a beginning to the grand finale. The series is still not over. I am still waiting for the fourth and the final book to release.</p>

<p>Another reason that I loved this series was that <em>January LaVoy</em> (the narrator) has done a wonderful job. She got all the characters and the creepy murders to life. Her narration affected me so deeply that I stopped listening to this series at night before going to bed. I do not recommend this book to people who don‚Äôt like horror or have overactive imagination. But if you love or can at least tolerate horror, then you must read this book. As <em>Evie</em> would say - ‚ÄúThis book is pos-i-tute-ly creepy!‚Äù.</p>

<h3 id="six-of-crows--crocked-kingdom---leigh-bardugo">Six of Crows / Crocked Kingdom - <em>Leigh Bardugo</em></h3>
<h4 id="rating---5-star-1">Rating - 5 star</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/my-fav-book-series-of-2018/six_of_crows.jpg" alt="Six of Crows" /></p>

<p><strong>Six of crows</strong> is full of action, adventure and twists in plot. <em>Kaz Brekker</em> is given a job to pull off the biggest heist in the history. For this job he gathers a crew of six people -  <em>a convict, a sharpshooter, a runaway, a spy, a heartrender (people with magic to manipulate flesh and blood) and a thief</em>.  Following this heist attempt in the <strong>Crocked Kingdom</strong> <em>Kaz and his crew</em> have to wage a war for their lives, for survival and for all they love.  <em>Crocked Kingdom</em> is a wonderful finale to the first book and keeps you on the edge of your seat.</p>

<p>I loved all the characters, especially - <em>Kaz and Inej</em>.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure. You can expect the unexpected from this series.</p>

<h3 id="lord-of-the-rings-fellowship-of-the-ring-the-two-towers-the-return-of-the-king---jrr-tolkin">Lord Of The Rings (Fellowship of the ring/ The two towers/ The return of the king) - <em>J.R.R Tolkin</em></h3>
<h4 id="rating---5-star-2">Rating - 5 star</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/my-fav-book-series-of-2018/lord_of_the_rings.jpg" alt="Lord of the rings" /></p>

<p>Lord of the rings is hands down my favorite movie. Now, the book is also one of my favorites. The journey of <em>Frodo Baggins</em> from the rolling  green hills of <em>Shire</em> to the heart of evil at <em>Mordor</em>  is as adventurous to me (everytime I read or watch the movies) as it was the first time.</p>

<p><strong>Fellowship of the ring</strong> starts with a hobbit <em>Frodo Baggins</em> inheriting a ring, which was in possession of his uncle <em>Bilbo Baggins</em>. This ring has powers. It is an evil ring (<em>‚ÄúOne ring to rule them all‚Äù</em>) and has its own will. The ring‚Äôs will is to return to its master <em>Sauron</em>, who was the evil defeated years ago by a human king. The responsibility of delivering this ring safely to the <em>King of Elves</em> falls on <em>Frodo‚Äôs</em> shoulders. But the path is not easy, the dark forces have already stirred. <em>Frodo</em> must endure mortal and immortal wounds and display courage to complete this mission.</p>

<p><strong>The Two Towers</strong> is next in this series. In this book <em>Frodo</em> begins another journey with the eight other brave companions. The mission is to destroy the ring in the volcanos of <em>Mordor</em>, where it was forged. But the ring has the history of corrupting men, women, wizards, dwarfs and elves. In the midst of evil, should Frodo trust his companions?</p>

<p><strong>The Return of the King</strong> is the third and the final book in the series. In this book <em>Frodo</em> continues his journey to destroy the ring. If he fails, evil will prevail and all will be lost!</p>

<p>For this one, I listened to the dramatized audiobook which had a cast of characters and sound tracks. If you ask me what I love most about this book, I will say it is difficult for me to pick. I love each and every character. Lord of the rings is to me what Harry Potter is to most people.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/my-fav-book-series-of-2018/a-darker-shade-of-magic.png" alt="A darker shade of magic" /></p>

<p>The final series on this list is <strong>A darker shade of magic</strong>. The story is about four London‚Äôs in parallel universes - <em>grey, red, white and black</em>. <em>Grey London</em> is one without magic, <em>Red London</em> is thriving with magic, <em>White London</em> has very little magic and <em>Black London</em>  is completly destroyed by magic. Only an <em>Antari</em> (distinguished by one black eye) has the power to travel through different Londons. There are only two <em>Antari‚Äôs</em> left in all the four worlds, one of whom is <em>Kell</em>.</p>

<p><em>Kell</em> serves the <em>Maresh Empire</em>, the family ruling the <em>Red London</em>. He is a messenger who takes messages from the kings of different london and delivers them to his king. Most people in this world can control only one or at max three elements. But, <em>Kell</em> being one of the most powerful magicians can control all elements - <em>Earth, Air, Water, Metal and Bone</em>. During one of his trips, <em>Kell</em> smuggles an item and unwittingly triggers a threat to <em>Red London</em>. A threat which can destroy it completely. Will <em>Kell</em> be able to save his London? And what sacrifices will he and his people have to make for it?</p>

<p>I loved all the characters of this book especially <em>Kell</em> and <em>Lila</em>. At the end of the book, I wished the book never got over. But all good things must end and so did this book.</p>

<p>I read a lot of series this year, but the once mentioned above were my top five picks. Coming up next -  <strong><a href="https://www.soumyathinks.com/personal/books/my-favorite-non-fictional-books-of-2018">My favorite non-fiction books of 2018</a></strong>. Till then, have fun reading!!!</p>
