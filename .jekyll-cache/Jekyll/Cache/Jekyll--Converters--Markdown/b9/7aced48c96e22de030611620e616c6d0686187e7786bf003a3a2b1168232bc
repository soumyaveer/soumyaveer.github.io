<p>I started this book thinking “It’s a memoir, might be a bit dry.” By the time I finished this book I realized how wrong I was.

While reading Shoe Dog, I found myself smiling, taking mental notes and even sobbing at certain places. I was’nt just reading the book, I was living the experiences of Phil Knight. That’s how good the book is.</p>
