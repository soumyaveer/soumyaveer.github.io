As a software engineer, reading is a big part of my job. It is also a significant source of my learning. I recently decided to learn more about the position of a Staff Software Engineer and picked up - [Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56481725-staff-engineer). These are the things I learned from the book as someone who is not a Staff Engineer yet.
