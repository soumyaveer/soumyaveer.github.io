Job search is even more challenging if you don’t have work experience, especially in Bay Area. Some people have asked me how I landed my first job in the last few years. So I decided to blog about the path to the big break that got me started as a Software Engineer in the Bay Area.<br><br>

#### Preparation for the job
I started by preparing for the actual job. This entails learning a programing language, doing some projects, and being confident that you can handle the tasks assigned to you on the job.

**Start with selecting a programming language.** Choosing and sticking with a programming language is very important. This language will be your companion for at least two to three years. For me, it was Ruby. I started by taking classes on platforms like Coursera and Udemy to learn the basics of Ruby. I also picked up a Ruby book on the side. Once I was comfortable with Ruby, I started learning the framework Ruby on Rails and then Javascript.

**Projects are a great way to test your knowledge.** Backed with the knowledge of basics, I started working on small projects. For example, once I finished learning Ruby, I built a calculator, which I kept expanding as and when I learned more advanced concepts. I did similar projects throughout my learning phase. Applying what you’ve learned will help you more than the learning itself.

**Structure your learning with a boot camp.**  Once I had enough knowledge to build apps, I decided to structure my learning by joining the boot camp.  I took the online do-at-your-own-pace package. The organization of courses is why I selected [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/welcome-to-flatiron-school). The study was divided into modules -  Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux. At the end of each module was a project with a live coding exam. You move on to the next module if the examiner accepts your project during the exam. This structure helped me practice explaining my project and was a tremendous mock practice for real-life interviews. <br><br>

#### Interview Preparation
**Learn algorithms and data structures.** Once I graduated from the boot camp, it was time to tackle the last bull by its horns - Algorithms! Algorithms and Data Structure are the most popular interviewing format in Bay Area. 

Till now, I was mainly preparing for the job. This is where my interview preparation began. I started by taking the Coursera class on Data Structures and Algorithms. And started coding every algorithm from scratch in [Ruby](https://github.com/soumyaveer/ruby-algorithms) and [Javascript](https://github.com/soumyaveer/javascript-algorithms) for practice and to understand how each algorithm works.

From there, I joined [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and started practicing algorithms daily. Once I gained confidence that I could crack the problems, I joined another boot camp which helped me with white-boarding and mock interview practice. I would schedule 1-2 mock interviews weekly and practice interviewing in an interview-like setting. <br><br>

#### Showcase your hard work

**Prepare a demo project.** Armed with all the learning and practice, it was time to set up a [project](https://www.soumyathinks.com/technology/projects/book-progress) I could showcase in my resume and online profile. I selected one and got to work on polishing it. I added the features on the backend, created a beautiful user interface, and recorded a demo video. 

**Build your online profile.** All the Lego blocks of my work so far were in place. It was time to put them all together and create a show-stopper. I got to work on building a blog, and after much consideration, I named it [soumyathinks. com](https://www.soumyathinks.com/). I put all the work I had done so far into this portfolio and started posting blogs about things I learned. <br><br>

#### Build a network of support.
Once everything was in place, it was time to build a support network. I reached out to people who could help me and whom I could help. Like-minded people who can be my support system. But before that, there was still more work to be done.

**Prepare an Elevator Pitch.** What is that, you ask? An elevator pitch is a 1-minute pitch that gives relevant information about you while introducing yourself to others.

The truth is that everyone is busy, especially people at networking events. People are mostly there because they are either looking for a position or trying to find people who will fit their roles. An Elevator pitch helps them understand more about you and if you will be a good fit for the position they are trying to fill. It also gives you the confidence to utilize the one-minute window without boring others or providing irrelevant information. Hey! First impressions matter! So help yourself and others by preparing a good elevator pitch.

**Attend networking events.** Networking events are a great place to build a network and showcase yourself. A great place to find these is [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) and [meetup](https://www.meetup.com). One of the most essential accessories during these events is a diary and a pen. These events often start with people being invited on stage to talk about their lives, journeys, and lessons learned. You can’t remember everything, so it is best to note any relevant information about them and their lives. This will help you establish a connection with them later. <br><br>

#### Start Applications 
All the work is done now! It is time to start applying for the positions. You’ll start getting leads from your network at this point. Start reaching out to them if you find any leads. Referrals are a great way of getting an interview.

**Look for open positions** on different platforms and the company's carrier pages.

**Read the job descriptions carefully and highlight any keywords in the job description.** For example, if the position is backend focused and you are a full-stack web developer. Move the backend-focused details on your resume to the top so that the interviewer can find the most relevant information easily. And, of course, highlight your backend projects.

**Set a goal for the number of positions you’ll apply daily.**  I had a goal of applying to at least five posts each day. This was a sweet spot for me to make the applications without feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work that goes into applications, like tweaking resumes, filling out details online, and writing a cover letter at times.  Yes, some companies still ask for these.
At the end of all this.  Recruiters from the companies will start reaching out to you. <br><br>

#### Persistence is the key
You might have to apply to many companies before a recruiter contacts you.  Don’t lose heart! Be at it. It took me consistent hard work and networking for almost four months before recruiters started reaching out and setting up interviews. It takes time, so be patient but be persistent. 

Nothing is more heartbreaking after all this hard work than getting an email saying the company is moving forward with other candidates. And that is fine. Feeling sad by rejection is a valid feeling. It is essential to learn from the failure and see what we can do better next time. You can ask recruiters for feedback. Some will respond, some won’t, and that’s ok too. It is essential to move on from the rejections and do your best in your following interview. 


### Conclusion
And this is it! This was my journey to my first big break. It was difficult, but persistence and learning from failures were the key.  I got a lot of rejections before I got my first offer letter. It was a lot of hard work, blood, sweat, and tears, but in the end, once I got my first job. It was all worth it!  I wish you all the best on your journey to starting as a Software Engineer.
